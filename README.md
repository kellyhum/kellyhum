### hi, i'm kelly! ðŸ‘‹
currently:
- going back to 0 and exploring coding projects that are actually fun and useful to me (read: not mandatory for school)
    - this includes: data analysis on Spotify, chrome extensions, various scripts (most work done in private repos)
- learning java/oop through a school course
- connecting with people who're funny, kind, and passionate about causes - reach out if you're also interested, i'd love to meet you!

cheers :)
