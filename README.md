Welcome to the literal front page of my Github profile!

A student currently exploring cybersecurity and software development, I'm always looking for my next new challenge, whether that's a CTF challenge or a coding project.

Right now, my favorite languages include Javascript and Python, although I can also do web (HTML, CSS) development.

If you're interested in cybersecurity, health at the intersection of tech, or accessible technology, feel free to reach out to me!
