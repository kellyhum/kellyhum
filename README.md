### hi, i'm kelly! ðŸ‘‹
currently:
- messing around with software and cybersecurity - building projects, playing in ctfs, learning to love leetcode :)
- curious about consumer-facing products, clean energy, and healthcare
- reading the chip war and mentally mind-mapping the companies that power semiconductors
- learning more about business as an enterprise architect intern for emerging tech (ai, ar/vr, and robotics) and cybersecurity!

in the past:
- interned as a frontend developer building with react/graphql/typescript

cheers :)
