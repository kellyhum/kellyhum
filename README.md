### hi, i'm kelly! ðŸ‘‹
currently:
- touching up on my html/css/js, aiming to learn react by the end of the year (dec 2023)
- learning more about writing and expression of self - stay tuned for a possible "learning in the open" site later on this year!
- connecting with people who're funny, kind, yet goal-driven and passionate about causes - reach out if you're also interested, i'd love to meet you :)
