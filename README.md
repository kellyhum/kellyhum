### hi, i'm kelly! ðŸ‘‹

(she/her)

I'm a high school student with an interest in STEM and design.

Currently developing my portfolio site, I'm in the process of improving my Javascript skills to be able to start learning React by September.  Also skilled with HTML, CSS, and Python (data science/ML/AI).

When I'm not troubleshooting code, I can be found nose deep in a good book, testing out that new bubble tea place, or jamming to some songs on Spotify.
