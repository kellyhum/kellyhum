### hi, i'm kelly! ðŸ‘‹

(she/her)

I'm a high school student with an interest in STEM and design.

Currently developing my portfolio site, I'm hoping to improve my Javascript skills to be able to start learning React by September.  Also skilled with HTML & CSS, and am learning Python for use with ML/AI/data science as part of a summer program.

When I'm not troubleshooting code, I can be found nose deep in a good book, testing out that new bubble tea place, or jamming to some songs on Spotify.
